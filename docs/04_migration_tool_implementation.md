# Building an ArcanoFlow Runes Migration Tool

*Date: May 21, 2025*

This document outlines a comprehensive approach to implementing the Svelte runes migration assessment as both a VS Code extension and a web application. These tools would help development teams more efficiently manage their migration from legacy Svelte syntax to the runes API.

## 1. VS Code Extension Implementation
