# Automated Debug System Implementation - Technical Specification

## Overview

The Automated Debug System for Arcano Sprint Manager automatically detects code issues, generates sprint tasks, provides visual indicators, and integrates with GitHub Copilot for automated fixes. This document details the technical implementation approach.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Issue Detection Module**
   - Leverages VS Code's Diagnostics API to collect errors, warnings, and hints
   - Uses ProblemScanner for specialized file-specific issues
   - Implements debounce mechanisms to prevent performance issues

2. **Task Generation Module**
   - Parses and updates sprint.md files with issue-based tasks
   - Creates properly formatted markdown task entries
   - Handles duplicate prevention and categorization

3. **Visual Status System**
   - Status bar indicator with color-coding based on issue severity
   - Quick pick interface for navigating to issues
   - Detailed issue report panel

4. **Copilot Integration**
   - Prompt generation tailored to specific issue types
   - Fix suggestion and preview capability
   - Feedback mechanism for applied fixes

## Implementation Details

### Issue Detection Flow

1. Diagnostics API monitors VS Code's native problem detection
2. Issues are filtered by severity and file type
3. Data is normalized to IssueDetail interface format
4. Results are stored and categorized for further processing

### Task Generation Process

1. Issues are converted to task format
2. sprint.md file is read (if exists) or created
3. New tasks are appended to the Debug Tasks section
4. File is written back with updated content

### Visual Status Logic

1. Status bar shows count with severity-based colors
   - Green: No issues
   - Yellow: Warnings only
   - Red: Contains errors
2. Quick pick presents issues with file/line navigation
3. Detailed view shows full issue listing by category

### Copilot Integration Method

1. Issue context is extracted with surrounding code
2. Prompt templates customize requests based on issue type
3. User approves suggested fixes before application
4. Results are tracked for effectiveness

## Data Structures

### IssueDetail Interface

```typescript
interface IssueDetail {
    file: string;
    message: string;
    severity: vscode.DiagnosticSeverity;
    line: number;
    code?: string;
}
```

## Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| enabled | boolean | true | Master toggle for the debug system |
| minSeverity | string | "warning" | Minimum severity level to track |
| autoGenTasks | boolean | false | Auto-generate tasks from issues |
| copilotFixes | boolean | true | Enable Copilot fix suggestions |
| excludedFolders | string[] | ["node_modules", ".git"] | Folders to exclude from scanning |

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| arcano.debugSystem.scan | Manually scan workspace for issues |
| arcano.debugSystem.showIssues | Show all detected issues |
| arcano.debugSystem.generateTasks | Generate sprint tasks from current issues |
| arcano.debugSystem.applyFixes | Request and apply Copilot fixes |

## Performance Considerations

1. Diagnostics collection uses debouncing (500ms)
2. File operations are async to prevent UI blocking
3. Large workspaces use batched processing
4. User-configurable exclusion patterns

## Integration Points

1. Extension activation initializes the system components
2. Status bar provides always-visible access point
3. Commands integrate with the VS Code command palette
4. File parsing connects to existing sprint.md structure
