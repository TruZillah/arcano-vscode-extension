# ArcanoFlow Extension Feedback Document

## Task Execution Experience

**Task:** Scan codebase for runes compatibility issues
**Date:** May 21, 2025
**Extension:** ArcanoFlow Sprint Manager (v1.0)

### How the Extension Works

The ArcanoFlow extension successfully transmitted the task request from the markdown task list. When the user clicked on the checkbox in `RUNES-MIGRATION-TASKS.md`, the extension triggered this conversation with the following request:

```
I'm working on this task from my sprint backlog: "**Scan codebase for runes compatibility issues**". Please help me implement it with detailed code examples and best practices.
```

### Task Request Analysis

The extension passed the task title but didn't automatically include the full context from the task description. Specifically:

- ✅ Included: The task title ("Scan codebase for runes compatibility issues")
- ❌ Missing: The detailed request ("Scan our codebase to identify all components with mixed syntax that will throw the '$: is not allowed in runes mode' error")
- ❌ Missing: The output destination (`docs/runes-migration/01_component_scan.md`)

This forces the user to either manually add this information or requires the AI to ask for it, which creates an extra step in the workflow.

### Suggested Improvements

1. **Include Full Task Context**: The extension could send the complete task details including the *Request* and *Output* fields specified in the task.

2. **Workspace Awareness**: Automatically provide information about where Svelte components are located in the workspace structure.

3. **Execution Tracking**: After a task is executed, automatically create the specified output file with metadata about the task execution.

4. **Visual Indicators**: Add visual indicators in VS Code showing which components need migration based on the scan results.

5. **Task Dependencies**: Add dependency tracking between tasks, so task #2 can reference outputs from task #1.

## Refined Task Description

The current task structure is good, but I'd recommend the following enhancements to make it more AI-friendly:

```markdown
- [ ] **Scan codebase for runes compatibility issues**
  *Request:* "Scan our codebase to identify all components with mixed syntax that will throw the '$: is not allowed in runes mode' error. Include file paths, issue descriptions, and a severity rating (High/Medium/Low) for each component."
  *Output →* `docs/runes-migration/01_component_scan.md`
  *Context Needed:* All .svelte files in /src directory
```

Adding specific details about what information should be included in the scan results and what context is needed would help make the AI response more precise.
