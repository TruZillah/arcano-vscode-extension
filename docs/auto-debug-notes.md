# Summary of the Automated Debug System Implementation

We've successfully implemented the Automated Debug System for the Arcano Sprint Manager extension. Here's what we've accomplished:

- [ ] 1. Core Debug Functionality
Created debugProvider.ts with:

- [ ] ArcanoDebugProvider: Provides debug configurations and default settings
ArcanoDebugTracker: Monitors debug session events and logs them
ArcanoDebugHelper: Provides high-level debug operations like task debugging
Implemented debugUI.ts with:

- [ ] Status bar integration for quick access to debug tools
Debug options menu for configuration and operations
Task selection interface for task-specific debugging
- [ ] Smart Breakpoints: Allows users to set breakpoints on key functions for targeted debugging
- [ ] 2. Python Script Enhancements: Updated sprint_manager.py with:
Enhanced logging with configurable verbosity levels
Task details display with timestamp tracking
Related file detection for tasks
Environment variable-based debug control
- [ ] 3. Configuration and Integration
- [ ] Updated package.json with:
  - [ ] New debug commands: "showDebugOptions" and "startAutomatedDebug"
  - [ ] Custom debug configuration properties
  - [ ] Debug configuration snippets
- [ ] Integrated debug system with existing Arcano Sprint Manager features

## Documentation

- [ ] Created automated_debug_system.md with comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Updated README.md to highlight the new Automated Debug System
- [ ] Updated CHANGELOG.md with details about the 1.0.7 release

### Testing

- [ ] Implemented unit tests for debugProvider.ts and debugUI.ts
- [ ] Created integration tests for the debug system
- [ ] Created debugSystem.test.ts to test the debug functionality
- [ ] Added complete test suite for debug provider and helper

### How to Use the Automated Debug System

## To use the Automated Debug System in the Arcano Sprint Manager extension, follow these steps

- [ ] Click the "Arcano Debug" button in the status bar
- [ ] Select "Debug Current Task" to debug a specific task
- [ ] Use the configuration options to customize the debug experience
- [ ] Add smart breakpoints for targeted debugging
- [ ] View detailed logs and task information during debugging

The implementation follows best practices with proper type safety, error handling, and a clean, intuitive user interface. The automated debug system will significantly improve the development workflow by providing detailed insights into tasks and streamlining the debugging process.
