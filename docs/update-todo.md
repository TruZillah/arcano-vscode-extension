# Automated Debug System Implementation Tasks

## Implementation Plan

### [Setup and Initialization]

- [x] Create necessary TypeScript interface definitions for problem tracking
- [ ] Set up extension configuration options for debug system
- [ ] Initialize debug system in extension.ts activation function
- [ ] Create logging utilities for tracking debug activities

### [Problem Detection]

- [ ] Implement VS Code diagnostics integration using vscode.languages.getDiagnostics()
- [ ] Create filtering mechanism for different severity levels
- [ ] Add file path filtering to focus on relevant project files
- [ ] Implement debounce mechanism for diagnostic collection to prevent excessive updates

### [Sprint Task Generation]

- [ ] Create function to convert detected issues to sprint task format
- [ ] Implement sprint.md file parsing and modification
- [ ] Add severity-based task categorization
- [ ] Implement safeguards to prevent duplicate task generation

### [UI Development]

- [ ] Design status bar indicator for showing current issue count
- [ ] Implement color-coded severity indicators (red, yellow, green)
- [ ] Create quick access buttons for viewing and fixing issues
- [ ] Add hover tooltips with issue summaries

### [Copilot Integration]

- [ ] Implement Copilot API integration for automated fixes
- [ ] Create prompt templates for different types of issues
- [ ] Add user confirmation dialog before applying automated fixes
- [ ] Implement feedback mechanism for tracking fix success/failure

### [Testing and Validation]

- [ ] Create sample projects with intentional errors for testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for each major component
- [ ] Create integration tests to verify end-to-end workflow
- [ ] Implement telemetry for tracking usage and effectiveness

### [Documentation]

- [ ] Update README.md with debug system usage instructions
- [ ] Document configuration options and default settings
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Add detailed code documentation with JSDoc comments

### [Integration & Feedback Loop]

- [ ] Implement continuous monitoring system for new issues
- [ ] Add notification system for alerting users to new problems
- [ ] Create feedback collection mechanism for users
- [ ] Implement self-diagnostic system to verify debug feature health
