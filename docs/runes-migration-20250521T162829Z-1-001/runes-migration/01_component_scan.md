# Svelte Runes Compatibility Scan

*Date: May 21, 2025*

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of components in the AutoDeck frontend codebase that need migration to Svelte's runes mode.

## Summary

- Runes mode is **enabled by default** in `svelte.config.js`
- No active components in the codebase are currently using the legacy `$:` syntax
- The project contains example components showing legacy syntax, runes syntax, and problematic mixed syntax

## Scan Methodology

We performed the following checks:

1. Examined `svelte.config.js` to determine if runes mode is enabled by default
2. Searched for components using legacy `$:` syntax
3. Searched for components using runes syntax (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`)
4. Analyzed example components created for runes migration
5. Checked for components with mixed syntax patterns

## Findings

### 1. Runes Configuration

Runes mode is already enabled by default in the Svelte configuration:

```javascript
// In svelte.config.js
compilerOptions: {
  runes: true, // Enable runes mode by default for all components
},
```

This means that any component using the legacy `$:` syntax will throw the error "$: is not allowed in runes mode" when compiled.

### 2. Example Components

The project includes several example components demonstrating different patterns:

| Component | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `LegacyComponent.svelte` | Legacy | Uses traditional `$:` reactive syntax |
| `RunesComponent.svelte` | Runes | Uses new runes syntax with `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect` |
| `MixedErrorComponent.svelte` | Mixed | Demonstrates the error when mixing syntaxes |
| `FixedRunesComponent.svelte` | Fixed | Shows how to fix mixed syntax issues |
| `UserProfileRunes.svelte` | Example | Practical example of a user profile using runes |

### 3. Active Components Status

None of the active components in the production codebase are currently using the legacy `$:` syntax. This suggests that either:

- Components have already been migrated to use runes
- Components are not using reactive declarations
- Components are using other patterns for reactivity

### 4. Potential Risk Areas

While no current components use legacy syntax, the following components have complex reactivity patterns that should be carefully reviewed:

1. `workflows/+page.svelte` - Uses array updates to trigger reactivity
2. `workflows/[id]/+page.svelte` - Has complex lifecycle management

### 5. Migration Path

The codebase appears to be well-positioned for runes adoption because:

1. Runes mode is already enabled by default
2. Example components exist to guide developers
3. No active components use legacy syntax that would cause errors

## Recommendations

1. **Documentation**: Update documentation to clarify that all new components should use runes syntax

2. **Template Components**: Create more template components for common patterns in the AutoDeck frontend, beyond the current examples

3. **Code Reviews**: Implement code review checks to ensure no legacy syntax is introduced inadvertently

4. **ESLint Rules**: Add ESLint rules to catch legacy syntax usage

5. **Training**: Provide training materials on converting common patterns to runes syntax

## Next Steps

With no immediate compatibility issues found, the focus should be on:

1. Creating guidelines for consistent runes usage
2. Identifying components that could benefit from runes syntax even if they don't use reactive declarations
3. Adding more comprehensive type checking with runes
4. Optimizing state management with `$state` and stores
