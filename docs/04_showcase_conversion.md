# Animation Presets Showcase Component - Runes Conversion Document

## Overview

This document outlines the conversion of the Animation Presets showcase component from the legacy Svelte reactive syntax to the new runes mode. This conversion serves as a reference implementation for ARCANO-RUNES-004 migration task.

## Conversion Patterns Applied

### 1. State Variables Using `$state()`

Legacy variables were converted to use the `$state()` rune:

**Before:**
```svelte
// Animation demo state
let selectedPreset: keyof typeof animationPresets = 'flowFadeIn';
let showDemo = true;
let customDuration = 300;
let customDelay = 0;
let selectedEasing = 'cubicOut';
let direction: 'left' | 'right' | 'top' | 'bottom' = 'left';
let distance = 20;
let isVisible = true;
```

**After:**
```svelte
// Animation demo state using $state runes
let selectedPreset = $state<keyof typeof animationPresets>('flowFadeIn');
let showDemo = $state(true);
let customDuration = $state(300);
let customDelay = $state(0);
let selectedEasing = $state('cubicOut');
let direction = $state<'left' | 'right' | 'top' | 'bottom'>('left');
let distance = $state(20);
let isVisible = $state(true);
```

### 2. Reactive Expressions Using `$derived`

Reactive statements were converted to use the `$derived` rune:

**Before:**
```svelte
// Get the selected easing function
$: easingFunction = easingFunctions[selectedEasing as keyof typeof easingFunctions];
```

**After:**
```svelte
// Get the selected easing function using $derived
const easingFunction = $derived(easingFunctions[selectedEasing as keyof typeof easingFunctions]);
```

### 3. TypeScript Type Definitions

We improved TypeScript definitions to be more explicit with the runes syntax:

**Before:**
```svelte
let selectedPreset: keyof typeof animationPresets = 'flowFadeIn';
let direction: 'left' | 'right' | 'top' | 'bottom' = 'left';
```

**After:**
```svelte
let selectedPreset = $state<keyof typeof animationPresets>('flowFadeIn');
let direction = $state<'left' | 'right' | 'top' | 'bottom'>('left');
```

### 4. Regular Functions (Unchanged)

Functions like `toggleDemo()` and `formatPresetName()` remained unchanged as they don't directly interact with reactivity:

```svelte
// Toggle animation demo
function toggleDemo() {
  showDemo = !showDemo;
}

// Format the preset name for display
function formatPresetName(name: string): string {
  return name.replace(/([A-Z])/g, ' $1')
    .replace(/^./, str => str.toUpperCase());
}
```

### 5. Documentation Comments

Added thorough documentation at the top of the component:

```svelte
/**
 * Animation Presets Showcase - Svelte Runes Implementation
 * 
 * This component showcases animation presets with interactive controls.
 * It has been converted to Svelte runes mode as part of the 
 * ARCANO-RUNES-004 migration task.
 */
```

## Benefits of the Conversion

1. **Explicit Reactivity**: The runes syntax makes it clear which variables are reactive state
2. **Better TypeScript Integration**: Type definitions are integrated directly with the state declarations
3. **Improved Code Organization**: Clear separation between different types of variables (state, derived, constants)
4. **Future Compatibility**: Aligned with Svelte's direction for components

## Lessons Learned

1. The conversion process is straightforward for components with simple reactivity
2. TypeScript types are more intuitive with runes
3. No special handling was needed for event handlers or bindings - they work the same with runes

## Testing Results

The component was tested and verified to work identically to the legacy version:
- All UI controls function as expected
- All animations display properly
- Reactivity works correctly with state updates

## Next Steps

To continue runes migration:
1. Convert other UI showcase components to runes syntax using similar patterns
2. Update tests to verify the functionality remains identical
3. Document any additional patterns discovered in more complex components
