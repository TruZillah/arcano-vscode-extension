# Automated Debug System Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Automated Debug System is a critical enhancement for the Arcano Sprint Manager that will automatically detect problems in your workspace, generate tasks, provide visual indicators, and help apply fixes. This document outlines the implementation strategy and technical details.

## Core Components

### 1. Problem Detection System

The implementation will build upon the existing `ProblemScanner` class, which already provides strong foundation for detecting various issues in different file types. The enhanced system will:

- Leverage VS Code's Diagnostics API to collect errors, warnings, and information from all language providers
- Implement real-time monitoring with optimized performance via debouncing
- Filter issues based on severity, relevance, and user configuration

### 2. Sprint Task Generation

The system will automatically create tasks in the sprint.md file when issues are detected:

- Tasks will be formatted according to the Arcano Sprint Manager protocol
- Tasks will include file location, line number, and issue description
- Tasks will be categorized by severity with visual indicators

### 3. Visual Status Indicators

Visual feedback will be provided through:

- A status bar item showing the total number of issues with color-coding
- Quick-access buttons for viewing issues and applying fixes
- Hover tooltips with issue counts by severity

### 4. Copilot Integration

The system will leverage GitHub Copilot to suggest fixes for common issues:

- Generate contextual prompts based on the issue type and surrounding code
- Present fix suggestions with preview capability
- Apply accepted fixes and track resolution success

## Integration Points

The Automated Debug System will integrate with the existing codebase at these key points:

1. **Extension Initialization**: The system will be initialized during extension activation in `extension.ts`

2. **Problem Scanner**: Enhanced integration with the existing `ProblemScanner` class to avoid duplicate functionality

3. **Sidebar View**: Add issues panel to the existing `ArcanoPanelProvider` sidebar

4. **Copilot Helper**: Utilize the `CopilotChatHelper` to request and apply fixes

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

- Implement `AutomatedDebugSystem` class with core functionality
- Add status bar indicator
- Setup basic diagnostics monitoring

### Phase 2: Task Generation

- Create sprint.md parsing and generation functionality
- Implement task categorization by severity
- Add duplicate detection mechanisms

### Phase 3: UI Enhancements

- Enhance status bar with detailed tooltips
- Add issue browsing functionality
- Implement severity filtering

### Phase 4: Copilot Integration

- Create contextual prompt templates
- Implement fix suggestion workflow
- Add user confirmation and application logic

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization

- Develop comprehensive tests
- Optimize performance for large workspaces
- Refine user experience based on feedback

## Configuration Options

The system will support these configuration options:

- `arcano.debugSystem.enabled`: Enable/disable the automated debug system
- `arcano.debugSystem.minSeverity`: Minimum severity level to track (error, warning, info)
- `arcano.debugSystem.autoGenTasks`: Automatically generate tasks in sprint.md
- `arcano.debugSystem.copilotFixes`: Enable Copilot fix suggestions
- `arcano.debugSystem.excludedFolders`: Array of folder patterns to exclude from scanning

## Commands

The system will add these commands to VS Code:

- `arcano.debugSystem.scan`: Manually trigger a workspace scan
- `arcano.debugSystem.showIssues`: Show all detected issues
- `arcano.debugSystem.generateTasks`: Generate tasks from current issues
- `arcano.debugSystem.applyFixes`: Request and apply Copilot fixes

## Technical Requirements

- TypeScript 4.8+
- VS Code API 1.60+
- GitHub Copilot extension

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. It correctly identifies issues across multiple file types
2. It generates properly formatted sprint tasks
3. The visual indicators accurately reflect the current workspace state
4. Copilot can suggest valid fixes for common issues
5. Performance impact is minimal, even in large workspaces
